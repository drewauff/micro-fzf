# Micro `fzf`

Inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/samdmarshall/micro-fzf-plugin), but fixed a few things that did not work on my Windows machine, plus added a few commands.

## Install

Clone this repo to you `/micro/plug` dir.

## Usage

You can run the help command `help fzf` or visit [this file](./help/fzf.md).
